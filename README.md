### Hi. 👋
I’m a computer nerd at heart. I’ve been fascinated with computers and technology since I was 5 when my dad first introduced me to the Commodore 64 computer.
I was officially hooked on computer to computer communication when a friend and I called our first BBS and thought we had somehow accidentally accessed a secret government mainframe. “WHAT IS YOUR NAME?” It asked. I gave a fake name. “WHAT IS YOUR LAST NAME?” ….I hung up and unplugged the phone line from the wall. I was scared to death at first, but underneath that fear was a boiling excitement that never really left me; that drove me to learn more and more as the years went on.From there I started tearing computers apart and learning how they worked inside and out. I also immersed myself web dev and mobile app development.
So I think I am a full stack developer and mobile app developer.
